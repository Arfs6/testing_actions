#: ../doc/strings.py:21
msgid ""
"Twitter is a social networking or micro-blogging tool which allows you to "
"compose short status updates of your activities in 280 characters or less. "
"Twitter is a way for friends, family and co-workers to communicate and stay "
"connected through the exchange of quick, frequent messages. You can restrict "
"delivery of updates to those in your circle of friends or, by default, allow "
"anyone to access them."
msgstr ""

#: ../doc/strings.py:22
msgid ""
"You can monitor the status of updates from your friends, family or co-"
"workers (known as following), and they in turn can read any updates you "
"create, (known as followers). The updates are referred to as Tweets. The "
"Tweets are posted to your Twitter profile or Blog and are searchable using "
"Twitter Search."
msgstr ""

#: ../doc/strings.py:23
msgid ""
"In order to use TWBlue, you must first have created an account on the "
"Twitter website. The process for signing up for a Twitter account is very "
"accessible. During the account registration, you will need to choose a "
"Twitter username. This serves two purposes. This is the method through which "
"people will comunicate with you, but most importantly, your username and "
"password will be required to connect TWBlue to your Twitter account. We "
"suggest you choose a username which is memorable both to you and the people "
"you hope will follow you."
msgstr ""

#: ../doc/strings.py:24
msgid ""
"We'll start from the premise that you have a Twitter account with its "
"corresponding username and password."
msgstr ""

#: ../doc/strings.py:25
msgid "### Authorising the application"
msgstr "### Autoryzowanie aplikacji"

#: ../doc/strings.py:26
msgid ""
"First of all, it's necessary to authorise the program so it can access your "
"Twitter account and act on your behalf. The authorisation process is quite "
"simple, and the program never retains data such as your password. In order "
"to authorise the application, you just need to run the main executable file, "
"called TWBlue.exe (on some computers it may appear simply as TWBlue if "
"Windows Explorer is not set to display file extensions). We suggest you may "
"like to place a Windows shortcut on your Desktop pointing to this executable "
"file for quick and easy location."
msgstr ""

#: ../doc/strings.py:27
msgid ""
"You can log into several Twitter accounts simultaneously. The program refers "
"to each Twitter account you have configured as a \"Session\". If this is the "
"first time you have launched TWBlue, and if no Twitter session exists, you "
"will see the Session Manager. This dialogue box allows you to authorise as "
"many accounts as you wish. If you press the Tab key to reach the \"new "
"account\" button and activate it by pressing the Space Bar, a dialogue box "
"will advise you that your default internet browser will be opened in order "
"to authorise the application and you will be asked if you would like to "
"continue. Activate the \"yes\" Button by pressing the letter \"Y\" so the "
"process may start."
msgstr ""

#: ../doc/strings.py:28
msgid ""
"Your default browser will open on the Twitter page to request authorisation. "
"Enter your username and password into the appropriate edit fields if you're "
"not already logged in, select the authorise button, and press it."
msgstr ""

#: ../doc/strings.py:29
msgid ""
"Once you've authorised your twitter account, the website will redirect you "
"to a page which will notify you that TWBlue has been authorised "
"successfully. Now you are able to close the page by pressing ALT+F4 which "
"will return you to the Session Manager. On the session list, you will see a "
"new item temporarily called \"Authorised account x\" -where x is a number. "
"The session name will change once you open that session."
msgstr ""

#: ../doc/strings.py:30
msgid ""
"To start running TWBlue, press the Ok button in the Session Manager "
"dialogue. By default, the program starts all the configured sessions "
"automatically, however, you can change this behavior."

msgid "### Buffer"
msgstr ""

#: ../doc/strings.py:36
msgid ""
"A buffer is a list of items to manage the data which arrives from Twitter, "
"after being processed by the application. When you configure a new session "
"on TWBlue and start it, many buffers are created. Each of them may contain "
"some of the items which this program works with: Tweets, direct messages, "
"users, trends or events. According to the buffer you are focusing, you will "
"be able to do different actions with these items."
msgstr ""

#: ../doc/strings.py:37
msgid ""
"The following is a description for every one of TWBlue's buffers and the "
"kind of items they work with."
msgstr ""

#: ../doc/strings.py:38
msgid ""
"* Home: this shows all the tweets on the main timeline. These are the tweets "
"by users you follow."
msgstr ""

#: ../doc/strings.py:39
msgid ""
"* Mentions: if a user, whether you follow them or not, mentions you on "
"Twitter, you will find it in this list."
msgstr ""

#: ../doc/strings.py:40
msgid ""
"* Direct messages: here you will find the private direct messages you "
"exchange with users who follow you , or with any user, if you allow direct "
"messages from everyone (this setting is configurable from Twitter). This "
"list only shows received messages."
msgstr ""

#: ../doc/strings.py:41
msgid ""
"* Sent direct messages: this buffer shows all the direct messages sent from "
"your account."
msgstr ""

#: ../doc/strings.py:42
msgid "* Sent tweets: this shows all the tweets sent from your account."
msgstr ""

#: ../doc/strings.py:43

msgid ""
"* Followers: when users follow you, you'll be able to see them on this "
"buffer, with some of their account details."
msgstr ""

#: ../doc/strings.py:45
msgid ""
"* Friends: the same as the previous buffer, but these are the users you "
"follow."
msgstr ""

#: ../doc/strings.py:46
msgid ""
"* User timelines: these are buffers you may create. They contain only the "
"tweets by a specific user. They're used so you can see the tweets by a "
"single person and you don't want to look all over your timeline. You may "
"create as many as you like."
msgstr ""

#: ../doc/strings.py:47
msgid ""
"* Events: An event is anything that happens on Twitter, such as when someone "
"follows you, when someone adds or removes one of your tweets from their "
"likes list, or when you subscribe to a list. There are many more, but the "
"program shows the most common ones in the events buffer so that you can "
"easily keep track of what is happening on your account."
msgstr ""

#: ../doc/strings.py:48
msgid ""
"* Lists: A list is similar to a user timeline, except that you can configure "
"it to contain tweets from multiple users."

msgid "* Search: A search buffer contains the results of a search operation."
msgstr ""

#: ../doc/strings.py:50

"liked by a particular user."
msgstr ""

#: ../doc/strings.py:51
msgid ""
"* Trending Topics: a trend buffer shows the top ten most used terms in a "
"geographical region. This region may be a country or a city. Trends are "
"updated every five minutes."
msgstr ""

#: ../doc/strings.py:52
msgid ""
"If a tweet contains a URL, you can press enter in the GUI or Control + "
"Windows + Enter in the invisible interface to open it. If it contains audio, "
"you can press Control + Enter or Control + Windows + Alt + Enter to play it, "
"respectively. TWBlue will play a sound if the tweet contains the \\#audio "
"hashtag, but there may be tweets which contain audio without this. Finally, "
"if a tweet contains geographical information, you can press Control + "
"Windows + G in the invisible interface to retrieve it."
msgstr ""

#: ../doc/strings.py:53
msgid "### Username fields"
msgstr ""

#: ../doc/strings.py:54
msgid ""
"These fields accept a Twitter username (without the at sign) as the input. "
"They are present in the send direct message and the user actions dialogue "
"boxes. Those dialogues will be discussed later. The initial value of these "
"fields depends on where they were opened from. They are prepopulated with "
"the username of the sender of the focused tweet (if they were opened from "
"the home and sent timelines, from users' timelines or from lists), the "
"sender of the focused direct message (if from the received or sent direct "
"message buffers) or in the focused user (if from the followers' or friends' "
"buffer). If one of those dialogue boxes is opened from a tweet, and if there "
"are more users mentioned in it, you can use the arrow keys to switch between "
"them. Alternatively, you can also type a username."
