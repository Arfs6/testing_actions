"    * Added basic support to notifications buffer. This buffer shows "

msgstr ""

#: ../doc/changelog.py:32
msgid ""
"Most of all changes in this release are focused on adding Mastodon "
"support to TWBlue. The features present to handle Twitter should not have"
" been altered in any way. We were not intended to release this version so"
" soon, but unfortunately, Twitter started to present issues in some "
"regions with one particular API endpoint we were using, making impossible"
" for everyone in such regions to use the application. We will release "
"more updates to fix any possible issue regarding Twitter API, but please "
"take into account that this is sometimes an issue happening in Twitter's "
"servers and while we do our best to make TWBlue work despite those "
"problems, you might encounter glitches from time to time."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"* TWBlue now builds with Python 3.10.8. ([#493](https://github.com/MCV-"

"in regions where it didn't work since last week."

#: ../doc/changelog.py:38
msgid ""
"* It is now possible to log in to instances of mastodon, hometown and "
"similar software (Pleroma should work as well, although it has not been "
"tested at this time). From the session manager, clicking on the “new "
"account” button will bring up a menu from which you can select whether "
"you want to log in to Twitter or Mastodon. For instances that have a "
"different character limit than the one set by Mastodon, TWBlue will "
"detect the new limit and adjust the dialogs to allow you to use it "
"correctly."
msgstr ""

#: ../doc/changelog.py:39
msgid ""
"* Most of the TWBlue GUI has been adapted so that the buffers reflect the"
" change of social network (in mastodon, for example, the buttons to write"
" posts say post instead of tweet). However, the menu bar has not yet been"
" updated. This means that most of the options still refer to Twitter, "
"although they can be used with mastodon accounts. For example, if you "
"select the “tweet” menu in the menu bar, and then select the “Retweet” "
"option, TWBlue will actually do a “boost” if the buffer you are in is a "
"Mastodon account buffer."

msgid "    * User autocompletion."
msgstr ""

#: ../doc/changelog.py:43
msgid ""
"    * Currently, it is not possible to update account settings for "

"you can close TWBlue, change your session file with any text editor and "
"restart the application to update what you want."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"    * It is not possible to view a user’s profile, nor edit your own, for"
" now. However, you can use the keystroke to open the item in the browser "
"when focusing a user to access their profile website. This only works in "
"buffers where users are listed."
msgstr ""

#: ../doc/changelog.py:48
msgid "    * You cannot manage lists in TWBlue at the moment."
msgstr ""

#: ../doc/changelog.py:49
msgid ""
"* Most of the buffers planned for mastodon should just work. Among those "
"currently tested are: home (main timeline for the logged-in user), Local "
"(public posts for the instance), federated (public posts for all "
"federating instances), mentions, direct messages, sent posts, favorites, "
"bookmarks, followers, following, blocked users, muted users, user "
"searches and timelines for users."
msgstr ""

#: ../doc/changelog.py:50
msgid ""
"    *  The difference between favorites and bookmarks is that the author "
"of the post can see who has marked his posts as favorites, but bookmarks "
"are completely private. In any buffer containing mastodon posts, except "
"direct messages, the GUI will display an option to add the post to "
"favorites or bookmarks."
msgstr ""

#: ../doc/changelog.py:51
msgid ""
"    * Direct messages in mastodon are posts, exactly like normal posts, "
"but with their privacy setting set so that they can only be seen by the "
"accounts that are mentioned. In the direct message buffer, a conversation"
" will appear for each item in the buffer. The conversation represents a "
"thread of messages, but TWBlue can only display the last of the messages "
"sent. This is similar to what happens on platforms like Telegram, where "
"you can only see the list of conversations at the beginning. To see the "
"entire thread of direct messages present in a conversation, you can use "
"the command to open the conversation, or go to the “tweet” menu in the "
"menu bar, and then towards the “view conversation” option. This will "
"create a new conversation buffer that will be located just after the "
"direct messages buffer (for the GUI, the buffer will be located just "
"inside the direct messages buffer in the buffer tree). When a private "
"post appears (whose visibility only allows the mentioned accounts to see "
"it), TWBlue will display that post in the home buffer, in mentions and "
"also will update/create the conversation with that item. This is because "
"Mastodon does not differentiate between a private message and a normal "
"post. You can reply to the post in any buffer to continue the "
"conversation. If you reply to any post, the privacy set in the original "
"post is maintained by default, but can also be changed."
msgstr ""

#: ../doc/changelog.py:52
msgid ""
"    * The buffer showing the federated timeline has been disabled from "
"settings. This is because on servers that federate with many instances it"
" can load many posts in a very short time. To enable this buffer, for "
"now, edit the TWBlue configuration while the application is closed, and "
"add the “federated” buffer in the option called “buffer_order”. As soon "
"as buffers can be shown or hidden, this process can be done through the "
"GUI."
msgstr ""

#: ../doc/changelog.py:53
msgid ""
"    * There is a Streaming API that allows the elements for the start "
"buffers, mentions, direct messages, sent posts and followers to appear in"
" real time. This feature is implemented by default and should also just "
"work."
msgstr ""

#: ../doc/changelog.py:54
msgid ""
"    * Timelines for users only allow to get all posts from users who are "
"in the same instance. For users belonging to other instances, you can get"
" the posts that have been downloaded to your instance since your instance"
" “knows” the remote user."
msgstr ""

#: ../doc/changelog.py:55
msgid ""
"    * Timelines for followers and following can be fully retrieved only "
"for users belonging to the same instance. Remote users may yield unclear "
"results."
msgstr ""

#: ../doc/changelog.py:56
msgid ""
"    * You can search by users (by opening a search and selecting the "
"“users” radio button). The search can be done by local users, such as "
"twblue, or by remote users, such as @twblue@maaw.social."
msgstr ""

#: ../doc/changelog.py:57

"* In all buffers, a maximum of 40 items are retrieved per load, but more "
"can be retrieved by using the option to load more items in the buffer."
msgstr ""

#: ../doc/changelog.py:58
msgid ""
"* In post buffers, you can do most of the actions already supported in "
"TWBlue (boost, add/remove from favorites or bookmarks, reply, send "
"message to user, open post URL, play audio or video, open post on web, "
"view conversation, open action dialog for user)."
msgstr ""

#: ../doc/changelog.py:59
msgid ""
"* In user buffers, you can send private message to the user, and open "
"user actions dialog, which in turn allows you to follow/unfollow, "
"block/unblock and mute/unmute."
msgstr ""

#: ../doc/changelog.py:60
msgid ""
"* When writing posts, it is possible to attach up to 4 images, 4 givs, or"
" even a video, poll, or audio. It is also possible to add the “sensitive "
"content” tag to posts, change privacy and write a content warning text. "
"It is possible to create threads using the “add post” button."
msgstr ""

#: ../doc/changelog.py:61
msgid ""
"* When replying to a post, TWBlue will place the username of all "
"participants in the item you reply to. The privacy options will default "

"* the user autocompletion feature has been completely rewritten to be "
"easier to use, particularly for people with many followers/following "
"users:"
msgstr ""

#: ../doc/changelog.py:66
msgid ""
"    * In the account settings dialog, there's a button that opens up a "
"new dialog that allows you to \"scan\" your account in order to add all "
"users from your followers/following list. This process will read your "
"data directly from Twitter and depending in the amount of people you have"
" in your account it might take too many API calls. Please use it with "
"caution. You can, for example, do the process separately for your "
"followers/following people so it will be easier to handle, in case you "
"have a massive amount of people. If TWBlue is unable to complete the "
"scan, you will see an error and will be prompted to try again in 15 "
"minutes, once your API calls have refreshed."
msgstr ""

msgstr ""

"templates, you can get an idea of the variables that are available for "
