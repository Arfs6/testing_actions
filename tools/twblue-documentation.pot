msgid "## Usage"
msgstr ""

#: ../doc/strings.py:31
msgid ""
"Twitter is a social networking or micro-blogging tool which allows you to"
" compose short status updates of your activities in 280 characters or "
"less. Twitter is a way for friends, family and co-workers to communicate "
"and stay connected through the exchange of quick, frequent messages. You "
"can restrict delivery of updates to those in your circle of friends or, "
"by default, allow anyone to access them."
msgstr ""

#: ../doc/strings.py:33
msgid ""
"You can monitor the status of updates from your friends, family or co-"
"workers (known as following), and they in turn can read any updates you "
"create, (known as followers). The updates are referred to as Tweets. The "
"Tweets are posted to your Twitter profile or Blog and are searchable "
"using Twitter Search."
msgstr ""

#: ../doc/strings.py:35
msgid ""
"In order to use TWBlue, you must first have created an account on the "
"Twitter website. The process for signing up for a Twitter account is very"
" accessible. During the account registration, you will need to choose a "
"Twitter username. This serves two purposes. This is the method through "
"which people will comunicate with you, but most importantly, your "
"username and password will be required to connect TWBlue to your Twitter "
"account. We suggest you choose a username which is memorable both to you "
"and the people you hope will follow you."

"We'll start from the premise that you have a Twitter account with its "

msgid "### Authorising the application"
msgstr ""

#: ../doc/strings.py:41
msgid ""
"First of all, it's necessary to authorise the program so it can access "
"your Twitter account and act on your behalf. The authorisation process is"
" quite simple, and the program never retains data such as your password. "
"In order to authorise the application, you just need to run the main "
"executable file, called TWBlue.exe (on some computers it may appear "
"simply as TWBlue if Windows Explorer is not set to display file "
"extensions). We suggest you may like to place a Windows shortcut on your "
"Desktop pointing to this executable file for quick and easy location."
msgstr ""

#: ../doc/strings.py:43
msgid ""
"You can log into several Twitter accounts simultaneously. The program "
"refers to each Twitter account you have configured as a \"Session\". If "
"this is the first time you have launched TWBlue, and if no Twitter "
"session exists, you will see the Session Manager. This dialogue box "
"allows you to authorise as many accounts as you wish. If you press the "
"Tab key to reach the \"new account\" button and activate it by pressing "
"the Space Bar, a dialogue box will advise you that your default internet "
"browser will be opened in order to authorise the application and you will"
" be asked if you would like to continue. Activate the \"yes\" Button by "
"pressing the letter \"Y\" so the process may start."
msgstr ""

#: ../doc/strings.py:45
msgid ""
"Your default browser will open on the Twitter page to request "

" fields if you're not already logged in, select the authorise button, and"
" press it."
msgstr ""

#: ../doc/strings.py:47
msgid ""
"Once you've authorised your twitter account, the website will redirect "
"you to a page which will notify you that TWBlue has been authorised "
"successfully. On this page, you will be shown a code composed of several "
"numbers that you must paste in the TWBlue authorization dialogue in order"
" to allow the application to access your account. Once you have pasted "
"the code in the corresponding text field, press enter to finish the "
"account setup and go back to the session manager. On the session list, "
"you will see a new item temporarily called \"Authorised account x\" "
"-where x is a number. The session name will change once you open that "
"session."
msgstr ""

#: ../doc/strings.py:49
msgid ""
"To start running TWBlue, press the Ok button in the Session Manager "
"dialogue. By default, the program starts all the configured sessions "
"automatically, however, you can change this behavior."

"If all went well, the application will start playing sounds, indicating "
"your data is being updated."

msgstr ""

#: ../doc/strings.py:61
msgid ""
"A buffer is a list of items to manage the data which arrives from "
"Twitter, after being processed by the application. When you configure a "
"new session on TWBlue and start it, many buffers are created. Each of "
"them may contain some of the items which this program works with: Tweets,"
" direct messages, users, trends or. According to the buffer you are "
"focusing, you will be able to do different actions with these items."
msgstr ""

"Twitter, you will find it in this list."

msgid ""
"* Direct messages: here you will find the private direct messages you "
"exchange with users who follow you , or with any user, if you allow "

msgid ""
"* Friends: the same as the previous buffer, but these are the users you "
"follow."
msgstr ""

#: ../doc/strings.py:73
msgid ""
"* User timelines: these are buffers you may create. They contain only the"
" tweets by a specific user. They're used so you can see the tweets by a "
"single person and you don't want to look all over your timeline. You may "
"create as many as you like."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"These fields accept a Twitter username (without the at sign) as the "
"input. They are present in the send direct message, the user actions "
"dialogue and the user alias dialogue boxes, to name a few examples. Those"

"depends on where they were opened from. They are prepopulated with the "

" home and sent timelines, from users' timelines or from lists), the "
"sender of the focused direct message (if from the received or sent direct"
