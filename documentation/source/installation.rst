Installation
-------------

TWBlue is available from its `Download page. <https://twblue.es/downloads>`_ On this page, you can always find the latest version of the application, completely free of charge. Currently, 4 different packages are distributed: two portable packages, for 32-bit and 64-bit systems; an installer, which selects the version to install depending on the architecture of the system where it runs, and a portable package for 32-bit, specially generated to be compatible with Windows 7.

:note: Windows 7 users must download the Windows 7 compatible package. Any other TWBlue package will be impossible to run under this operating system.

If you downloaded a portable version, simply unzip the file into an empty directory and run the twblue.exe file.

If you downloaded the installer, open the twblue_setup.exe file and follow the instructions to install the software. The installer will select the best version for your operating system architecture. When finished, you will be able to run TWBlue from the desktop or the windows start menu.
