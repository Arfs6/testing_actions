System requirements
==========================================

In order to run TWBlue successfully on a computer, these are the minimum system requirements. Please note that while it may be possible to use TWBlue under more limited resources, it is not recommended because the experience may be degraded or the application may not work as expected:

* Processor: Dual core processor, 1.3 GHZ or higher.
* Operating system: Windows 7 (service pack 1), Windows 8/8.1, Windows 10 or Windows 11.
* Hard Drive: Minimum 200 MB of free space.
* RAM memory: 4 GB.

:note: TWBlue is compatible with Windows 7 systems (requires service pack 1 to be installed) in a special version, available on the `Project downloads page. <https://twblue.es/downloads>`_ This version is only available in a portable package, for 32-bit systems, and cannot be updated automatically. Windows 7 users will need to update TWBlue manually every time there is a new version to keep using the application.
